# Conflist

## Hej

[Conflist](http://mrqwest.co.uk/conflist) is a checklist for those who are attending or organising an event. It was built as a weekend project to play around with the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](http://h5bp.github.com) and some PHP. I built this back in 2010ish so pretty old now and not a reflection of my current coding habits.

There is also a separate flavour of Conflist, [Conflist for Organisers](http://mrqwest.co.uk/conflist/organisers/) which has a tweaked list suitable for those *organising* an event.

I do however, think it's a fairly valuable tool, if only for me to play around with so I'll be updating it periodically over the forthcoming weeks and perhaps rebuilding in JS or Ruby depending on my mood. I'll also attempt some new standard and consistant icons rather than the mishmash that's already there.

So... on to the to-do list

## To Do

* New colour palette
* New logo / Mark
* New consistent Icon set
* Refactor the existing code - make it lighter, strip out the faff
* Standardise chunks of code and re-use across Conflist & Conflist for Organisers.
* Fix the horrible typography
* Speed up
* Make those emails prettier
* Make things a little easier on mobile.
